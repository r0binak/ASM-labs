# ASM-labs
Labs work assembler with your favorite teacher in the first semester on NASM, x86.

laba_1:
Integer computation, floating point computation, and integer comparison with regard to coding method. 

laba_2:
Explore ways to handle arrays (vectors). Explore x86 addressing methods for working with arrays.
Tasks: Find the largest modulo value. Check if there is a strict alternation of positive and negative
elements.

lab_3:
Explore Binary Search Tree (AVL tree). Implement algorithms for finding, inserting and deleting keys. 
Tasks: Write in assembly language subroutines that implement algorithms for working with a binary search tree, check the correctness of the code using test suites.
